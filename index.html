      <b> About Thom Yorke: </b>
      <ul>
      <li> Born 7 October 1968 </li>
      <li> English musician and the main vocalist and songwriter of the rock band Radiohead </li>
      <li> A multi-instrumentalist, he mainly plays guitar and keyboards and is noted for his falsetto </li>
      <li> Considered one of the most infuential musicians of his generation </li>
      
        </ul>
        </p>
      <p> The reason I chose Thom Yorke is...
      <ul>
        <li> I love moody electronic music </li>
      




        <li> Unlike a lot of other bands or people... Radiohead doesn't try to tell you what you should think, it just makes you think sometimes </li>
        
        <li> People say Radiohead is depressing- but actually, I always think it's kind of hopeful </li>
        </p>
        <p> He's even inspired me to try and make my own <a href="https://usererrorr.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"> music </a>
